just a fun thought i had
markov chains for "ai" text making

(in reality this is just statistically significant text)
much of what i do is based off of [this](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos126/assignments/markov.html)

didn't want to bother with uppercase/lowercase so now it's just all lowercase
